1. **Economic Recovery**: Japan is experiencing a recovery characterized by increased consumer spending and business investment. With a GDP of approximately 30.33 trillion yen in 2025, this growth suggests a strengthening economy, supporting bullish sentiment in the stock market.

If Japan's central bank shifts from its current low-interest stance, it could create a favorable environment for domestic and foreign investors alike.

5. **Technological Growth**: The ongoing advancements in technology sectors are expected to boost profitability for companies in the Nikkei index. As firms adapt to digital trends, these sectors could outperform, driving index growth.
